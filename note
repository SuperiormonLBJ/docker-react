# docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .

Here the node_modules folder is auto created when we use npm to create project, but actucally we dont, so we can safely delete
need this folder in that we will do the download in docker filesystem. So this local folder (150mb this case) wiill cost extra time when copy from local to docker fs.
